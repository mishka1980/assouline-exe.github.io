          Some of my favorite study spots
 Render Coffee; Columbus Ave, Boston
Very sweet chai lattes. The main attraction is the sunroom at the back, which fills up quickly. Feel surrounded by the outdoors while cozily doing work indoors. I&amp;rsquo;d like to return when it&amp;rsquo;s rainy.

          My name is Shannon and I am currently studying cybersecurity at Northeastern University.
Here you&amp;rsquo;ll find a collection of my personal projects, cyber resources I have found useful, and brief reviews of my favorite coffee shops and libraries to study in.
 Academic Interests Broadly, my current interests lie in:
 Cyber operational planning Threat analysis Incident response  As I further explore different fields within cybersecurity, I anticipate these interests to be refined.
